# hostel-portal

It is a hostel portal website which is designed with me along with 2 more members of my project group who contributed in the front end of the website.
The website is meant to keep track of every hostelite student details and the warden details of every hostel block in our college.
There is also a section where student can just login with their id and can complaint against the hostel authorities in case of several hostel issues
Notifications tab will soon be added such that all the messages are received in the form of an alert notifications.

In order to run the site locally install the XAMPP Live Server and then visit the htdocs folder inside the xampp folder .Now create some new folder and copy all the files and folders given in the github repo.Once done ,now open your XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MYSQL services and also click on the admin button on the right side of the MySQL in the XAMPP control panel .There you need to import my sql file which i have put so that all the tables of the corresponding database gets added.And at last preview the index.php on localhost.You'll see my website:)
